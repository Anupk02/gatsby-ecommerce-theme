        <h2>Plant Nursery Starting For Beginners:</h2><br><br>
<p><strong>Introduction to Plant Nursery:</strong> A nursery is a portion of agriculture where plants are propagated, nurtured, grown, and sold out to the home garden or commercial purpose. Under favorable conditions, improved quality seedlings are grown until they are prepared for planting on a small scale or on a big scale. Young plants which are propagated in nurseries can be sold in retail nurseries or as wholesale nurseries. The sole purpose of all nurseries is to provide young plants or saplings to gardens, farms, agriculture, forestry, and conservation.</p><br><br><br>
<p>A nursery plant center offers its customers all types of young plants that are local (native), imported, and exotic. A nursery customer could be a home gardener, landscape gardener, or even a commercial farmer.

If sufficient space is available in your backyard, it's the right place to begin a nursery business if you are a beginner. An open area is all it requires to start a plant nursery.
